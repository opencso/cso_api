* api for the cso
** notes
*** I want to create a restful api for the cso
*** cso.json.ie/dataset/time_start-time_end/Statistic/any/other/variables.csv|.json
*** thats the kind of format I want 
*** return a csv file or a json file
** use the cso json-stat api as a data source
*** I have a scraper already which I can run weekly and update
*** any tables that have changed
** postgres database as the backend
